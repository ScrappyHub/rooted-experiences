# ROOTED Experiences — Application Architecture

ROOTED Experiences is the adventure, recreation, tourism, and activity vertical.

It is the “go do something” layer of the ROOTED OS.

It connects:
- Outdoor adventures  
- Recreation sites  
- Guided experiences  
- Adventure vendors  
- Seasonal activities  

Governed by ROOTED Core & Platform law.

## 🌲 Vertical Doctrine

Experiences is NOT a thrill-seeking platform.

It is:
- Family-safe  
- Locally grounded  
- Discovery-first  
- Community-focused  

It avoids:
❌ Unsafe adventure promotion  
❌ Mature tourism  
❌ Hidden pricing manipulation  
❌ Gig-style labor

## 🛑 Architectural Non-Negotiables

- Kids Mode must REMOVE all risky adventure content  
- No vendor may advertise age-restricted experiences to minors  
- Discovery follows card & radius limits  
- Seasonal overlays enforce safety (flooding, snow, heat)
